## Blackjack

### Skill Distillery Week 3 Homework

#### Description
  This project simulates a game of Blackjack.

  The user is presented with a menu
  asking if they would like to begin the game. If the user chooses to play,
  the game begins and the user is dealt a hand of two cards. The dealer's top
  card is also displayed. The player is asked if they want to hit (be dealt
    another card), stay (allow the dealer to take a turn), or exit the game.

    If the player hits and goes over 21, they bust and are asked if the want to
    play again. If the player chooses to play again, their hand and the dealer's
    hand are discarded and they are dealt new hands.

    If the player stays, it is now the dealer's turn. The dealer then displays
    it's second card to the player. If the dealer's hand value is below 18, then
    they dealer must draw. If the dealer goes over 21, the player wins. If the
    dealer goes over 18 and stays under 21, then the hands are compared to see
    who wins. If the hands are equal then the game is a push and there are no
    winners.
